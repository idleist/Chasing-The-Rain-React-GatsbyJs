#Chasing The Rain Website
## Built with GatsbyJS

This was my first attempt at the Gatsby framework.  It is a simple website for my brothers debut novel.  

I have used graphql and gatsby-image for all the images on the site.  This was a great project after learning React, to create a static website with Gatsby.
